//! Mollusk SVM Fuzz: Mollusk-compatible fuzz fixture for SVM programs.
//!
//! Note: The fixtures defined in this library are compatible with Mollusk,
//! which means developers can fuzz programs using the Mollusk harness.
//! However, these fixtures (and this library) do not depend on the harness.
//! They can be used to fuzz a custom entrypoint of the developer's choice.
